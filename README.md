# 🧪 Week 11 Wed Lab: Exploring Probing Techniques in Closed Hash Tables

## 🎯 Objective
This lab demonstrates how **different probing techniques** affect the performance of hash tables that use **closed hashing (open addressing)**.  
You will implement and analyze three probing strategies:

- **Linear Probing with Skips**
- **Quadratic Probing**
- **Double Hashing**

The experiment measures the **number of probes**, **insertion and search times**, and compares their **complexities** under various load factors.

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Implement hash tables with closed hashing in C++.
2. Use and compare different collision resolution strategies.
3. Measure and interpret the effect of load factor and skip value on performance.
4. Analyze the **time complexity** of insert and search operations.

## 🧩 Implementation Overview

### Table and Experiment Parameters
| Symbol | Description | Value |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `M` | Hash table size | **101** |
| `N` | Number of keys to insert | **80** |
| `c` | Skip factor for linear probing | **3** |

> These values ensure the table is not full (load factor ≈ 0.79) and collisions occur frequently enough to compare techniques.

### Note:
You need to implement code in the HashTableClosed.tpp and LinearProbing.hpp, QuadraticProbing.hpp and DoubleHashing.hpp.

To access the base class functions and fields in the derived classes, you should use **this->**. For example you will use this->M instead of M in LinearProbing.hpp, QuadraticProbing.hpp and DoubleHashing.hpp.

## ⚙️ Hash Functions

- Primary hash function:  
  ```cpp
  h1(key) = key % M
